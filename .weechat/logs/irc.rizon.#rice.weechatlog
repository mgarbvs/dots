2016-02-15 14:25:41	kian	I don't want it just for ssh
2016-02-15 14:25:50	kian	like wget, nano, etc

2016-02-15 14:42:44	DANtheBEASTman	kian: you're using plain cygwin? try babun
2016-02-15 14:43:08	DANtheBEASTman	it's like a cygwin distro

2016-02-15 14:43:16	Aigis	http://babun.github.io/ - Babun provides a package manager called pact . It is similar to 'apt-get' or 'yum'. Pact enables installing/searching/upgrading and deinstalling cygwin packages ...
2016-02-15 14:43:23	kian	huh...
2016-02-15 14:43:24	kian	this looks better
2016-02-15 14:43:38	kian	Can I tunnel SSH ports with it as well?
2016-02-15 14:43:51	DANtheBEASTman	you'll have to TIAS
2016-02-15 14:43:55	kian	TIAS?
2016-02-15 14:44:07	DANtheBEASTman	Try It And See
2016-02-15 14:44:14	kian	oh
2016-02-15 14:44:22	kian	So it is cygwin
2016-02-15 14:44:22	kian	just pre-configured?
2016-02-15 14:44:24	DANtheBEASTman	basically
2016-02-15 14:44:53	DANtheBEASTman	but it also provides pact, which is the biggest benefit
2016-02-15 14:44:55	kian	so right now cygwin is installing...
2016-02-15 14:44:55	DANtheBEASTman	meh i'd cancel it
2016-02-15 14:45:01	kian	Cancel it or wait then uninstall?
2016-02-15 14:45:05	trumpster	what is pact?

2016-02-15 14:46:57	kian	DANtheBEASTman, can I customize the window for it
2016-02-15 14:47:03	kian	to make it look nicer then what appears to be command prompt

2016-02-15 19:51:50	zinn	maybe
2016-02-15 19:51:55	mikel	the stack and heap are different sections of memory in the computer
2016-02-15 19:52:04	zinn	im not real clear on physics as it pertains to programming
2016-02-15 19:52:21	jimble	It's actually really simple.
2016-02-15 19:52:32	jimble	So I would just need more of concepts that I can translate anyway.

2016-02-15 21:26:21	+LambdaComplex	Kool-AD: bspwm
2016-02-15 21:26:32	+LambdaComplex	done it before
2016-02-15 21:26:35	+LambdaComplex	worked great
2016-02-15 21:26:41	Kool-AD	nice, thanks
2016-02-15 21:26:48	+LambdaComplex	also ran bspwm standalone with xfce4-panel
2016-02-15 21:26:50	+LambdaComplex	worked great too
2016-02-15 21:27:58	DANtheBEASTman	because awesome has floating mode, doesn't require re-compiling or patching for really anything, and is for the most part pretty simple to configure
2016-02-15 21:28:30	+LambdaComplex	>layouts aren't a thing you make on the fly, but instead are things you write in lua 
2016-02-15 21:28:32	+LambdaComplex	no thanks
2016-02-15 21:29:10	DANtheBEASTman	just offering opinions, not objective facts.
2016-02-15 21:29:40	trumpster	i3 a best
2016-02-15 21:29:56	+LambdaComplex	does i3 work well with xfce?
2016-02-15 21:29:59	+LambdaComplex	i've never tried it
2016-02-15 21:30:09	trumpster	idk
2016-02-15 21:30:17	DANtheBEASTman	panels would be an issue, for sure..
2016-02-15 21:30:23	trumpster	im on antergos
2016-02-15 21:30:31	DANtheBEASTman	i suppose you could kill the panel but then at what point are you still using xfce
2016-02-15 21:30:36	Kool-AD	im on *buntu

2016-02-15 21:32:30	DANtheBEASTman	Kool-AD: tell you what, ignore any advice or suggestions you receive here (including this), and maybe just test out thigs on your own? install i3, awesome, bspwm, and anything else you can think of, and decide which you prefer most

2016-02-15 21:49:14	fullsalvo	metakirby5: gotcha
2016-02-15 21:49:15	trumpster	thanks
2016-02-15 21:49:41	metakirby5	current plans are to use euclidian distance from the color extremities
2016-02-15 21:50:07	fullsalvo	converting the color spectrum into a 2d plane?
2016-02-15 21:50:09	Kool-AD	what other channels are worth checking out on rizon for khv permavirgin losers?
2016-02-15 21:50:10	metakirby5	i.e. imagine color as a 3d space w/ R,G,B coords and pick the color with the shortest line between it and the proper color
2016-02-15 21:50:16	Kool-AD	im new

2016-02-15 21:50:19	fullsalvo	ah 3d
2016-02-15 21:50:24	fullsalvo	makes sense
2016-02-15 21:50:57	fullsalvo	turn hexadecimal values into linear bases and find the magnitude of separation
2016-02-15 21:51:06	metakirby5	could brute-force it but i'd like to think of a more elegant algorithm to get the minimal distances
2016-02-15 21:51:32	fullsalvo	change of basis sounds like the hard part in that
2016-02-15 21:51:39	metakirby5	change of basis?
2016-02-15 21:52:11	fullsalvo	hex values --> numeric values
2016-02-15 21:52:14	metakirby5	also Kool-AD i like your dtop, you pulled off the flat look well
2016-02-15 21:52:17	fullsalvo	since each one goes 00 --> ff
2016-02-15 21:52:22	metakirby5	just the ubuntu logo contrast is a bit weird
