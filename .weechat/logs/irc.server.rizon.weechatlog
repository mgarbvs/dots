2016-02-07 14:13:54	 @	NickServ (service@rizon.net): Passwords should not be easily guessable.  For example,
2016-02-07 14:13:54	 @	NickServ (service@rizon.net): using your real name as a password is a bad idea.  Using
2016-02-07 14:13:54	 @	NickServ (service@rizon.net): your nickname as a password is a much worse idea ;) and,
2016-02-07 14:13:54	 @	NickServ (service@rizon.net): in fact, NickServ will not allow it.  Also, short
2016-02-07 14:13:54	 @	NickServ (service@rizon.net): passwords are vulnerable to trial-and-error searches, so
2016-02-07 14:13:54	 @	NickServ (service@rizon.net): you should choose a password at least 5 characters long.
2016-02-07 14:13:54	 @	NickServ (service@rizon.net): Finally, the space character cannot be used in passwords.
2016-02-07 14:13:54	 @	NickServ (service@rizon.net):  
2016-02-07 14:13:54	 @	NickServ (service@rizon.net): The parameter email is not optional on this
