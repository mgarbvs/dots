2016-02-08 17:23:31	fifel	niXon: All categories in Marx's capital are continuously politically contingent.  It is possible, every day, to shoot the bosses.
2016-02-08 17:23:39	trumpster	commies
2016-02-08 17:24:04	niXon	Yes, but is what we'd put in their place better?
2016-02-08 17:24:30	fifel	niXon: history doesn't deal in better.
2016-02-08 17:25:01	niXon	One can have worker's control without the abolishment of markets, money, the police, laws, the military, ...
2016-02-08 17:25:36	niXon	Even Wall Street has been recently experimenting with cooperatives.
2016-02-08 17:25:45	fifel	No, because of the requirement to maximise profit that corporations are bound by
2016-02-08 17:26:06	fifel	Even outside of that, imposing wage labour on yourself is being your own boss, it isn't the abolition of bossing.
2016-02-08 17:26:15	fifel	You're not in control if you're required to control yourself in specific ways
2016-02-08 17:26:18	niXon	Yes, but the current democratic crisis comes from deregulation of the markets.
2016-02-08 17:26:40	fifel	You are aware of the crises of the regulated markets, 1968-1984?
2016-02-08 17:26:46	niXon	The markets are not only your boss, but also the politicians' boss.
2016-02-08 17:26:51	niXon	fifel, No, I'm not.
2016-02-08 17:27:15	fifel	Between 1933 and 1984 most world markets tended towards regulation (USSR, US Military Industrial Complex, Labourism, Social Democracy, etc.)
2016-02-08 17:27:43	fifel	This included the regulation of the labour market in the interests of promoting higher quality labour power (longer lived, less drunk, more literate, more willing to perform to time motion and hours)
2016-02-08 17:28:13	fifel	By 1968 it became obvious that the SD-Labourite-Keynsianist-Welfareist Military Industrial-Stalinist consensus had failed: Mai '68, Czechoslovak workers councils
2016-02-08 17:28:25	fifel	Workers resisted the imposition of control over them, specifically "quality" controls
2016-02-08 17:29:02	niXon	Why, in your opinion, are market regulations bound to fail?
2016-02-08 17:29:05	fifel	The response was to deregulate the market, take the accumulated profits that had been reinvested through the 1960s and "realise" them for the bourgeoisie as income, destroy the workers' institutions, destroy the states' support of workers.
2016-02-08 17:29:13	fifel	Market regulations are bound to fail because they're a variety of capitalism.
2016-02-08 17:29:19	 <	monte (~monty@went.mad.in.Pyroland) has quit (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
2016-02-08 17:29:30	fifel	Each variety of capitalism faces a crisis in the expanded reproduction of the value form ("profitability" + "control over workers")
2016-02-08 17:29:36	niXon	Well, that's a circular argument.
2016-02-08 17:29:49	fifel	If there were a militant labourite movement comprising 40% of the workforce, we'd see reregulation instantly.
2016-02-08 17:30:01	niXon	Capitalism is bad. Why are market regulations bad? Because they're capitalist. Why is capitalism always bad?
2016-02-08 17:30:12	fifel	Not really, the epistemic escape to the empirical is the study of rates of profit and worker resistance at the point of production.
2016-02-08 17:30:32	fifel	It isn't that capitalism or regulation are bad, it is that they both produce historical crises that force change.
2016-02-08 17:30:39	fifel	There's no "bad" in history
2016-02-08 17:30:42	fifel	Or Marxism for that matter.
2016-02-08 17:30:47	fifel	Just what is
2016-02-08 17:31:28	niXon	The knowledge-seeking escape to the practical is the study of rates of profit and worker resistance at the factories.
2016-02-08 17:31:43	fifel	Sorry, I'm using jargon.
2016-02-08 17:32:03	niXon	And if there is no bad in history, then why is a middle-way between capitalism and Marxism bad?
2016-02-08 17:32:10	niXon	Or, dysfunctional, sorry.
2016-02-08 17:32:32	 >	Shusui (~qwebirc@FFA7C001.F72DA428.F4C4CFAC.IP) has joined #4chan
2016-02-08 17:32:33	niXon	Other than "because it's actually capitalism". 
2016-02-08 17:32:34	fifel	What makes me not go up my own bumhole, is that we can look at evidence of capitalism's crises.  We can look at the falling rate of profit in a particular variety of capital.  We can look at how workers find ways to fuck with each new variety of capital.  Thus demonstrating the claim "All varieties of capital produce their own crisis"
2016-02-08 17:32:57	fifel	niXon: Well, it is more that a middle way is impossible.  You can't be half pregnant.  You can't be half free.
